                        Spending nights hitchhikin', where will I go?
                        I could fly home with my eyes closed
                        But it be kinda hard to see, that's no surprise though
                        You can find me, I ain't hiding
                        I don't move my feet when I be gliding
                        I just slide in and then I roll out
                        Yeah, well, climbing over that wall
                        Swear the height be too tall so like September I fall
                        Down below, now I know that the medicine be on call, yeah
                        It's feeling like you hot

                    We don't see no lines, we don't color inside
                    It's a very small world, we don't fuck with the size
                    Yeah, see the bigger picture when it's beneficial
                    Lovin' how I catch you, blow the whistle when you run out of time
                    Yeah, wakin' up I open up my eyes
                    Do you mind if I blow your mind?
                    A little closer, baby, don't be shy
                    Why you worried that it's gon' be, fine?
                    I guess it's that kinda day
                    It's really all I'm tryna say
